Roadmap
=======

As the project evolves, a roadmap will be published for each major release. Comments, suggestions, and requests to the current roadmap are welcome. Our goal in publishing a roadmap is transparency and community inclusion. A roadmap is the team's best guess based on experience, community requests, and feedback.
